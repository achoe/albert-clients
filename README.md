# Clients for the Alfred server
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/kqJEONr.jpg)
In this repository exists source code for different clients in different languages.

The main design for the different language adaptations is to ALWAYS emulate the native way of handling events and/or message pumps.

## Languages

#### JavaScript
 - [Node.js module](/javascript/nodejs/README.md)
 

#### CSharp
 - [.NET 2.0 Compatible Class](/csharp/dotnet2/README.md)
